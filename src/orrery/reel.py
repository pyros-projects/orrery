"""Reels: one screenplay for a chain of H3 Motion Context clips.

    @h3 text 9:16
    $venue = __couture_venue__             the head is the world: it rolls once per seed
    SCENE the opening
    $look = __couture_form__               a scene rolls anew in every segment it plays
    SHOT 6s: tracking, slow
    …
    END ON: the model reaches the end of the runway
    SCENE the rotation forever             ×N | forever: one segment per repetition
    $look = __couture_form__
    SHOT 6s: static
    A model in $look~1 walks back while one in $look walks in.   $x~N: x as it was N clips ago
    SEND: frame 0 to image 3               this clip's frame 0 is image 3 for every later clip
    SEND: frame -1 to image 4 for segment 6+          its last frame, only for segments 6, 7, 8 …
    CUT TO: the opening ×2                 after this scene, back to that one (twice, then on)
    ? $look[kind=gown]: CUT TO: the finale   a jump on what this clip rolled

The words of an earlier orrery keep working, with the same dice: CHUNK for SCENE, `repeat N` and
`repeat forever` for ×N and forever, HANDOFF: for END ON:, GOTO: for CUT TO:.

A segment is one clip. Its seed derives from the node's seed and the segment number, so every
clip is reproducible and a repeated scene still varies; `$x~N` recomputes the earlier clip's
bindings instead of remembering them. The previous segment's END ON: opens this one (`START WITH:
the door bursts open` opens it instead), its own closes it, and from the second segment on Shot 1 also covers the frames Motion Context pins.

`REMEMBER:` (`SEND:`, the earlier word, writes `to` for `as` and `for segments` from 0 for `in
clips`) keeps frames of a scene's clip for the clips after it:

    REMEMBER: first frame as @KEEPER        his picture: the CAST's image of his, or a free slot it gets
    REMEMBER: frame at 1s as image 2        a frame by word, by second or by number (frames 34-46, -1)
    REMEMBER: every 10th frame as refmod jinx_today      a RefMod made of them (every Nth: a step)
    REMEMBER: every 5th frame of 1s-4s as refmod jinx_walk   … of a range
    REMEMBER: last frame as image 3 in clips 2-5      only those clips (from 1); `until the return`:
                                                       until that scene first plays

`SEND:` hands frames of a scene's clip (counted from 0 in the clip Chain Video keeps, the pinned
frames trimmed off; -1 is the last) to later clips as a reference image, the CAST's `image N`;
several frames make one image batch. A scene that repeats sends from the first time it plays.
`for segment 4+` / `4, 6, 7` / `2-5` limits the clips that get it, so several lines may fill one
image in turns. Orrery Refs fetches the frames; where they do not exist, the compiler leaves the
image out of the clip.

`CUT TO: <title or number> [×N] [(30%)]` at a scene's end jumps instead of going on: N times (then
the scene after it), or for good without ×N; with a chance, only that often. Several CUT TO: lines:
the first that holds and has jumps left wins; `? cond: CUT TO: …` holds on what that clip rolled. So the path through the scenes is walked
clip by clip (`Reel.walk`): which scene a segment plays can depend on the seed.

`AFTER: <title or number>` in a scene makes it continue the last clip of that scene instead of the
clip before it, so many scenes can branch off one clip (each with its own `SET:`): its opening
sentence, the frames Orrery Continue pins, `$x~N` and what was sent follow that chain. A scene that
repeats continues itself from its second time on.

`SCENE the forest (test)` is a test scene: rendered and kept, but Orrery Film leaves it out of the
film. It starts afresh (unless an `AFTER:` names a scene), and a scene after it continues the last
clip that is in the film. What it sends and rolls reaches the clips after it all the same: the
memory follows the clips in order, the picture follows the film (`Reel.recalls`, `Reel.before`).

The head is the scene of the Orrery Prompt's input video, if one is wired: `REMEMBER:` there keeps
frames of that video for every clip, `END ON:` there is how it ends, and a scene with `AFTER: the
input video` continues it (its last 22 frames, picture and sound, and that END ON:).
